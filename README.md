# Password Generator Utilizing Javascript

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to create a password generator utilizing Javascript. The password generator will allow the user an option of determining which type of characters to be included in the password and the length of the password. The simple yet responsive design of the website is stream-lined for use on various screen sizes. 

In completing this project I have learned the fundamentals of Javascript; including the use of variables, functions, for loops, and event listeners.
